these are the elaborated concepts that can be generated by my very special api:
"""
# understanding the ai interaction mechanism
the thing with the <br> token is, it's like a clear line drawn to tell the system, "start from here, and don't mess up." but it's not just about catching what's written after that. it's about making sure it feels like my thought process is truly being mirrored in the output.
<br>
setting the desired output format and content length
here's the thing. the length of the stuff this system puts out needs to be close to what i originally put in. like if i write a long bit, the concepts should cover a similar length. and it's not just about quantity. the meaning, the vibe, it needs to tie back to the original topic.
<br>
capturing a unique communication style
my way of speaking, the way i phrase things, it's different, you know? and the system should get that. not just echoing back my words but getting the whole feel of it. it should sound like something i'd genuinely say. so when others who are familiar see it, they'd think, "yep, that's how he talks."

these were extracted by pasting this into the input field (these may or may not be nicely formatted text.)

yes but i want you to encapsulate my particular style of writing. i dont mean the mistakes in punctuation or in mistyping or grammatical errors. i mean the way i can interact with this weird new concept of a interface
yes exactly but actually i think it would be better than the length of the text should be around the length of the supplied string when all counted together so most of them would be two to three concpets and their wordcount together would be approximately around the amount of text in the original text. the content in the atomic concepts should also place it elegantly into the context of the original string and how it is linked to the other concepts of the text. now do that with the following past experience of ours: Understood. I see that you want the instruction set to reference the token <br> as the delimiter for the beginning of the textual content from which the concepts will be extracted, and it's within the same string. Here's a suitably constructed instruction:

yes but they are still way to short. it should generalyl be around 250 words but not a lot less than that but almost never more than 300 words
okay now you got the bigger point. but in my eyes the concepts we actually really discussed here were 1. figuring a way to make the interface to this black box understand how i want the concepts to be split 2. the format of the concepts and the approximate length of its content 3. that the length of the concepts should actually be about one to three mostly about two paragraphs in length but with my particular style of writing and you can also look at the past

now i will take the first one and change it to the way i would write it:
"""
# api to the machine
it seems like its most important to clearly tell the ai what you mean by the underlying concepts. you have to clearly show by this example that its already possible and by writing this i had a new idea that i wrote down in a note somewhere: "i need to use this to automatically generate a new website that somehow sells this idea -> or gets funding" and understand that by writing this piece of text this would again contain two concepts that could be extracted again. and then there is just the way to write a python script that could just use this as an example and automatically provide a possible workflow to automate the next task. and now again you see that theres another concept here lol :)
"""

Apply this exact splitting and formatting to the following text snippet and only give me the concepts that my api would have generated for me:
